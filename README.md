# AngularBasics

## Requirements
1. Install node.js from here (I ususally prefer the LTS version for its stability) -> https://nodejs.org/en/ . This gives you the ability to access npm.
2. Install Angular CLI by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install -g @angular/cl`. This gives you the ability to access ng commands


## Creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI
1. Run the following command in your terminal: `ng new <app-name>`.
 
 
## Running the Angular project
1. Run the following command in your terminal: `cd <app-name>`. This command takes you into the project folder.
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Creating a new component (Branch 001-Creating-a-new-component)
1. Angular CLI allows us to create a component using the following command:


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
